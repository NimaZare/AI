But it ended up being a little under. Why do you think that is?\n","\n","Remember that neural networks deal with probabilities. So given the data that we fed the model with, it calculated that there is a very high probability that the relationship between x and y is y=2x-1, but with only 6 data points we can't know for sure. As a result, the result for 10 is very close to 19, but not necessarily 19.\n","\n","As you work with neural networks, you'll see this pattern recurring. You will almost always deal with probabilities, not certainties, and will do a little bit of coding to figure out what the result is based on the probabilities, particularly when it comes to classification."],"metadata":{"id":"VF7kni9rW9Zh"}}]}
